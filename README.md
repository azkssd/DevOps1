# Docker Discovery
The primary goal of this work was to discover of Docker, images and containers, while creating a 3-tiers web application (Database, Backend API, Http server) with docker-compose.

The final images can be found on dockerhub : https://hub.docker.com/u/azkssd

We used for the HTTP server the image :  
https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd  
for the backend API :  
https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk  
and for the Database :  
https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres

## 1-1 Document your database container essentials: commands and Dockerfile.
## 1-2 Why do we need a multistage build? And explain each step of this dockerfile.
## 1-3 Document docker-compose most important commands. 
## 1-4 Document your docker-compose file.
## 1-5 Document your publication commands and published images in dockerhub.
